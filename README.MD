# Shot Range Project

Here, we'll be looking at the impact of shooting within different zones on a basketball court. We'll see how much shots within each zone are worth and who takes the most/least efficient shots.

We'll also explore the idea of changing the value of a mid-range shot. Why is it's value the same as a layup? How and who would it impact most?
